# What makes it hard to compete with a software business?

Concept of a moat: passive attributes of a business relative to its industry that protect economic returns from the inevitable erosion of competition in free market systems.
what is a winner take all market? one where V(moat) in a large market share firm >> V(moat) in a small market share firm
Patterns
“network effects” (demand-side economies of scale)
Present when customer N+1’s usage increases the value for customer N.
Concepts:
Nodes
How many node types? (e.g. eBay vs. telephones)
Is the network effect definition true for each node type?
Distinct vs. overlapping roles (Airbnb = overlapping)
Multihoming costs (being on multiple platforms, like Lyft and Uber or Facebook and ConnectU)
Single player mode vs. multiplayer mode (is it valuable to N=1?)
Edges
Direction (directed vs. undirected)
Degree of enhancement (how big is the marginal improvement)
Edge use frequency
Nodes vs. edges
Density (edges / nodes)
Clustering / local density: (Facebook friends almost always share a mutual friend)
localities (e.g. Uber)
What isn’t a network effect: and what it is
Customer acquisition: word of mouth
Congestion is the opposite of a network effect
E.g. fullness on an airplane: flyer  N+1 destroys value for flyer N
E.g. city streets: driver N+1 destroys value for driver N
“entrenchment”
Income stream
The chance to make money is profoundly motivating
Income streams are phenomenally sticky, especially recurring ones
Even better: passive (dividends) or semi-passive income streams (Patreon)
E.g. Payment companies, marketplaces, subscriptions, membership sites
switching costs (setup cost [especially data portability, systems interaction, and user training], ongoing costs, or benefit forgone)
Switching = Become a new customer and stop being an existing customer
don’t underestimate the stickiness of enterprise products; enterprises are very lazy especially for relatively small bills
unclear benefits of switching: is it really going to be better / is this grass is greener syndrome? especially relevant to enterprises who will weigh cost vs. benefit
Emotional ties: e.g. switching investment advisors, abandoning an enterprise sales relationship
seamless interface products from the same firm work exclusively with the first product or better than other product (e.g. Excel and Word), or are much easier to setup with the first product (e.g. (Apple iPhone and Airplay)
Complex product e.g. knee replacement kits for surgeons
Trained & established interface where customers are so habituated to using the product a certain way that they’re reluctant to change e.g. old people not switching from gas to electric
Customers always need it think auto insurance where it’s required by law. Or tobacco where they are addicted.
lazy customers (“if it’s good enough, let it be”) who don’t want to put forth effort to switch, even if it won’t cost them much time and it will save them a lot of money. e.g. GEICO “15 minutes could save you 15% or more” is specifically designed to make customers think about the cost / benefit
insignificant price (usually compared to total cost of item being produced; e.g. $0.50 chip in $250 of total part cost for an iPhone
insignificant price difference vs. competitor e.g. renter’s insurance at $100 per year; maybe a competitor can do $110 or $120 but it’s not worth the pain
search costs
e.g. Kayak vs. non-kayak markets; how easy is it to:
1) get an offer
2) compare offers
perceived superiority (“brand”)
that benefit price or customer acquisition cost
n.b. this usually results from superior marketing or product experience at some time
(“cost advantage”)
sources: supply-side economies of scale (volume-driven), different model (e.g. Square underwriting vs. bank underwriting)
efficient cross-sell and halo effect e.g. banks selling checking and credit cards because they own the customer relationship
loss-leader strategy is often supported by efficient cross-sell and halo effect
“huge, prerequisite infrastructure” e.g. railroad tracks, power grid, pipeline, semiconductor production
exclusive contract: e.g. microsoft bundling IE / other software; MS-DOS being the OS of IBM, Apple Watch only works with the Apple iPhone
Product is available everywhere: like Facebook is not allowed in China, so opens the door for a Chinese copycat
Twitter
core social network
network effect: global, two-sided, between followers and promoters
advertising
brand: weak, but differentiated audience
platform: meh
Facebook
core social network
network effect: millions of local networks “all my friends are there”
switching costs: huge investment by individual users in building their profiles (photos, photo tags)
software platform business
network effect: two-sided (users and developers)
junk web content
network effect: two-sided (audience wants junk content, and publishers provide it)
supply-side economies of scale: able to deliver content to billions for free
Google
search and other web products
brand: like Coke, blind-tested users prefer non-Google search but ascribe higher value to Google search, assuming it will just work; same with Gmail; note that initially this was due to Google actually having a product 10x better (speed, etc.) than the competition
huge prerequisite infrastructure: huge data uniquely enables Google to deliver superior search results
available everywhere: search is available via any web client; Gmail is available even on iOS; Gmail fails over to IMAP / POP
exclusive contract: weak benefit of bundled search with Chrome
network effects: weak network effects from gmail
prereq infrastructure: weak investment in servers to crawl the web
adwords
network: own such a huge % of search traffic that advertisers must use adwords to reach certain consumers; advertisers pay for two things: i) access to audience and ii) ROI / ways of validating and optimizing ROI
economies of scale: huge data uniquely enables Google to deliver superior ad targeting and pricing
adsense
network: own such a huge # of ads in inventory that publishers have to choose Google
android
network: weak user / publisher network effects
exclusive contract: default search is Google on Android
exclusive contract: weak benefit of bundled Google software
Oracle (databases)
switching costs: data structures, database features, application calls, and operational knowledge produce enormous switching costs; to a lesser extent the data itself would have to be migrated
switching costs: seamless interface with other Oracle products
Microsoft (Windows, Office, Server)
network effects: Windows platform, but this diminishes with web as a platform
switching costs: Windows platform, Windows Server, Office, seamless interface
brand: in corporate and server markets anything besides Microsoft is unthinkable, but this will change with time
Amazon (online store)
network effect: two sided, with buyers and sellers
further: one-sided, with reviews
brand: winning by a mile on price, selection, and convenience; soon to have a titan brand
further, perhaps no retailer ever has ever managed (price, selection, and convenience) all at once
supported by declining % of Amazon traffic from search; people are directly navigating to Amazon
cost advantage: technical operations and automation vs. other online, and no retail presence
switching costs: low, but setting up credit card and shipping info
available everywhere: important for physical → digital transitions like books, but here Kindle software is distributed on many platforms
Uber (personnel and goods logistics)
brand: chiefly from fast pickup (see network effect) but minimally from app quality, features like business vs. personal card
network effect: two-sided, hyper-local network effects for clients and drivers
density is another way to describe hyper-local network effects
1. more clients → more drivers
2. more drivers → more density of drivers → shorter wait times and more geo availability
3. shorter wait times and more geo availability → more clients AND increased brand
(the standard two-sided network effect in a marketplace)
except that for a normal marketplace, like {eBay || Amazon}, #2. looks like “more sellers → more diverse goods for buyers && more volume of goods for buyers → more buyers”
further, there is a secondary benefit of shorter wait times
economies of scale: less driver downtime = more efficient utilization; can be used to lower prices (a very strong competitive differentiator because the market is so price sensitive) or take excess profit
cost advantage: as the market “fills in,” efficient cross sell and halo effect on the driver side is possible, e.g. delivering logistics
cost advantage: insurance costs
huge, prerequisite infrastructure: data for routing and matching
huge, prerequisite infrastructure: review data to kick out bad drivers → better product → brand
network effect: weak effect for the splitting of rides between clients
