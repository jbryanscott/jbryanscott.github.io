I’m often asked by friends or startups I advise for a practical reading list that provides context, expected skills, and common vocabulary for the new job. Below is the reading list I gave to my new hires at **Square** when I led the risk, data science, and Square Capital teams. For each section the list is deliberately short—because I’m picky about signal-to-noise when requiring others to read. Hope you find this helpful:


### General Business
- [Business Adventures][1]: the ubiquitous moral failings of executives when given improper incentives
- [Understanding Michael Porter][2]: cogent summary of Porter’s famous five forces

### Making Good Investments
- [The Intelligent Investor][3]: see sections on Mr. Market and intrinsic value

### Startups
- [Zero to One: Notes on Startups][6]: the best of Peter Thiel
- [Marc Andreessen’s Blog Archive][7]: the best of Marc Andreessen (free!)

### Product Management

- [The Entrepreneur’s Guide to Customer Development][9]: optimization method product-market fit
- [Predictably Irrational][10]: memorable examples of irrational human behavior

### Data Science

- [The Checklist Manifesto][19]: create, refine, and adhere to checklists to improve performance (link is to a free summary rather than the actual book)
